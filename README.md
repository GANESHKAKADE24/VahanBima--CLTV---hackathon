# VahanBima--CLTV---hackathon
The goal of this project is to predict and improve the lifetime value of customers for Vahanbima
The goal of this project is to predict and improve the lifetime value of customers for Vahanbima, a provider of insurance services. Specifically, we aim to use historical customer data to build a model that accurately predicts the future revenue and profit generated by each customer. By understanding the factors that contribute to customer lifetime value, we can identify the most valuable customer segments and develop strategies to retain and grow those segments. Additionally, we will analyze the customer data to identify any patterns or trends that may suggest opportunities for improving the overall customer experience and increasing customer loyalty
